# 🌍 Mifundo Full-Stack Architecture & Implementation

> **A full-stack, domain-driven system architecture and implementation blueprint inspired by [Mifundo](https://www.mifundo.com/), designed to showcase real-world backend, infrastructure, and frontend expertise in building scalable financial platforms.**

---

## 🚀 About the Project

This project is a **reverse-engineered interpretation of Mifundo’s platform**, developed from the ground up to demonstrate hands-on experience in building **multi-tenant, secure, modular financial applications**. It reflects how Mifundo could be architected under clean, domain-aligned principles, with a focus on:

- 💡 System thinking & backend architecture
- 🔐 Scalable authentication & authorization
- 📄 Document & credit handling workflows
- 🧾 Verified credit data portability
- 🖥️ Responsive frontend with Angular

Whether you’re viewing this as a developer, recruiter, or platform architect — the goal is to **bridge the gap between design and delivery** by bringing real fintech concepts to life in code, diagrams, and contract-first APIs.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Showcase **production-grade backend architecture** using a service-oriented approach
- ✅ Apply **Domain-Driven Design** (DDD) in modeling credit, profile, and document domains
- ✅ Use **OpenAPI** for precise API contract definitions across services
- ✅ Demonstrate knowledge in **RBAC, multi-tenancy, observability, and event-driven workflows**
- ✅ Build a **minimal functional app** reflecting Mifundo’s core value: **"credit history that travels"**
- ✅ Highlight **frontend capabilities** using **Angular** for responsive UI design

## 💡 Why This Project?

> “If you want to build trust through credit, your system must be as trustworthy as your mission.”

Mifundo’s vision is incredibly inspiring — offering **cross-border, portable credit** for individuals locked out of traditional finance. This repo is my contribution to that vision: a fully engineered backend system, supporting the kind of modular, secure, and interoperable infrastructure that such a platform demands.
